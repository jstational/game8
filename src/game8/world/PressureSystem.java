 * It should always call Update on split or merge. 
 * To get SystemPressure, it should calculate the total output of ALL PressureGenerators in the system passed into PressFormula. */
// oh no not this again
// I dont know a single thing about dynamic stuff
// how do i obtain a pressuresystem of a building without checking every time?
// i have an idea: for every adjacent update, check the whole system that it is in and remap all pressys of the grouping accordingly
